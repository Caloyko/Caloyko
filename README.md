# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Caloyko
I'm a **computer engineer specialized in healthcare** with a degree from *EPITA* and currently a **PhD researcher working on rare diseases** working with *AMC* and *ERDERA*.
My focus? Making medical data more **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) to improve **diagnosis and patient care.**

- Passionate about data, ontologies, and making sense of complex medical information.
- Always up for discussions on semantic interoperability, data standards, and rare disease research.
